Design Decisions:
Framecaster to be shared on socials, so that CTA is on socials directly which can help boost the voting ratio, which is a huge challenge for DAOs.

Token Streaming instead of locked for a year, since not all projects can be bootstrapped for a year, but a quarter is possible.

Mandatory Voting delegation of the grantee's votes to make it decentralized and unbiased voting on their projects.

EAS resolver to stop streaming when the project has less than 45% of the votes at any point in time.This helps the projects stay on track to complete the project on time while keeping the community informed of the progress.
